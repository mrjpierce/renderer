# ModernGL 3D Renderer Roadmap

## 1. Renderer Class Simplification

The `Renderer` class is quite large (400+ lines) and handles multiple responsibilities. We could split it into smaller, more focused classes:

- **Camera** - Handle all camera-related functionality
- **ShaderManager** - Handle shader loading and compilation
- **InputHandler** - Manage user input and controls

## 2. Improved Documentation

### Inline Comments
While there are good comments, some complex sections could use more detailed explanations, especially around:
- The matrix math in the rendering pipeline
- The shader variable bindings
- The coordinate system transformations

### Docstrings
Add more detailed docstrings with examples, especially for public methods.

## 3. Code Organization

The `renderer.py` file could be split into multiple modules:
- `camera.py` - Camera controls and view matrix calculations
- `shaders/` - Directory for shader-related code
- `core/` - Core rendering functionality

## 4. Beginner-Friendly Examples

Add more simple example scenes that demonstrate individual concepts:
- Basic shapes (cube, sphere, etc.)
- Lighting examples (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- Texture mapping
- Simple animations

## 5. Error Handling and Debugging

- Add more descriptive error messages for common mistakes
- Include debug visualization options (normals, wireframe mode, etc.)
- Add validation for shader compilation and linking

## 6. Interactive Documentation

- Consider adding Jupyter notebook examples that demonstrate key concepts
- Include visual diagrams of the rendering pipeline

## 7. Simplified API

- Create a simpler, higher-level API for common operations
Add convenience functions for common tasks (e.g., create_cube(), 
load_texture()
)
8. Learning Resources
Add links to learning resources for OpenGL and 3D graphics
Include a "Learning Path" section in the README for beginners
9. Performance Considerations
Add comments explaining performance-critical sections
Include tips for optimizing rendering performance
10. Testing and Examples
Add more test cases that demonstrate different rendering techniques
Include before/after examples for visual comparison
